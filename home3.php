                    Cancer is a scary word and once it enters a conversation about your pet you may not be able to concentrate on anything that is said after the ‘C’ word is
                    spoken.

                    <p>
                        When we talk about lumps, growths or tumours we are usually talking about neoplasia. A neo-
                        plasm is a bunch of cells that forms a lump or tumour and it is the result of uncontrolled growth
                        of cells. This may be due to a mutation or a lack of programmed cell death (apoptosis). A neo-
                        plastic tumour may be benign or malignant.
